  ## :pencil: Description

Concentration Game is a minigame based off the traditional card game of Concentration, sometimes called Memory. 
The goal is to have an array of face down cards and to flip them over in pairs, and if they match those cards are no longer in play.
Should the cards not match, they are placed back face down in the same position, and you must continue flipping cards over in pairs to try
and find every cards identical partner. 

This version of the minigame is based on the universally critic acclaimed hit animated series Avatar the Last Airbender and features characters, logos, 
and sounds from the series. In this version of the game you have 12 cards with 6 pairs in the spread of cards. You are given 7 incorrect guesses and 2 minutes
before the game is over. To win you must match all of the cards before either of those parameters are exceeded.
